      How do I approach designing software?
      - I start by conceptualizing the final scene visually, either in my head or will draw a rough draft on paper. This allows me to follow a structured approach as I develop towards the final outcome. During the various stages of development I will make continuous changes that alter the original sketch of the product. This allows me to create something that is better than what I had originally designed mentally, while also gaining an appreciation for the design process. 
    
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        - Understanding how objects are crafted in a 3D environment give me a much greater appreciation for the role that graphics and visualization have in our current society. Nearly every component of technology relies on graphical visualization in some way, and getting to see how those pieces fit together was very humbling. This fresh perspective helped improve my design skills by giving me a better appreciation for the meticulous detail that goes into building visual environments and objects. 
        
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
        - Trying to manipulate objects as best as posssible to fit the desired object was the design process that I mainly followed. By manipulating the objects size, orientation, scale, position, color, and texture all helped in acheiving the desired result. 
        
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
        - By realizing the final result will not always turn out the way you expect is the best tactic I think I could implement. Understanding the right mindset to originally maintain when developing software will help keep fresh ideas flowing when trying to acheive a specific result. 
        
    How do I approach developing programs?
    - Starting with answering questions related to "What am I trying to acheive with this program?" and "What should this look like when I am finished?". Each of these help me when developing programs. 
    
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
        - Breaking down an already constructed program and attempt to reverse engineer some of the components to see how each individual part worked helped me to understand how the entire program behaves. 
        
        How did iteration factor into your development?
        - Learning how to iterate properly helped to save a lot of time, space, and complexity when it came to development. Implementing this is crucial to being a successful developer I think. Iteration and near obsession play a big role when acheiving desired results. 
        
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
        - Seeing each piece of the puzzle come together at the final milestone was satisfying, like finally understanding how a piece of art is made or crafted. I think this changed the way I view developing code by realizing that focusing on individual parts until you're satisfied before moving on helps to bring the bigger picture together at the end of the program. It also helps to save a lot of time in refactoring code you're not particularly satisfied with. 
        
    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    - Computer Science can help me reach my goals in many ways, as it is a gateway for professional career growth while also allowing me an outlet for creative growth as well. 
    
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
        - Understanding how computational graphics and visualization work ultimately help me understand how each piece of software I take for granted is derived. When I look at a simple object and think about the sheer volume of complex math like linear algebra and physics that is combined. It is very eye opening. 
        
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
        - I think by seeing how graphics and visualizations is the culmination of several other disciplines like math and physics, gives me inspriation. There is still so much to learn when it comes to being successful in a computer science career. Digging into the basics now will certainly help me achieve my professional goals.
